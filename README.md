2. here if you want go to pointer -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/POINTER

3. here if you want go to queue -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/QUEUE

4. here if you want go to searching -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SEARCHING

5. here if you want go to sorting -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SORTING_C

6. here if you want go to stack -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/STACK
