# ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURE
here for due project and challenge for me to do more with coding from my class with my lecture.			


   
1. here if you want go to linked list -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/LNKED_LIST/LINKED_LISTt.c

2. here if you want go to pointer -> 
https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/POINTER/POINTER.c

3. here if you want go to queue -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/QUEUE/QUEUEe.c

4. here if you want go to binary searching -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/SEARCHING/BINARY%20SEARCH.c
   here if you want go to linear searching -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/SEARCHING/LINEAR%20SEARCH.C

5. here if you want go to bubble sorting -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SORTING_C
   here if you want go to insertion sorting -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SORTING_C/INSERTION%20SORT
   here if you want go to selection sorting -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SORTING_C/SELECTION%20SORT
   here if you want go to challenge sorting -> 
https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/tree/main/SORTING_C/CHALLENGE

6. here if you want go to stack -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/STACK/STACKk.c

7. here if you want go to tree -> https://github.com/Mario080/Algorithm_Data_Structure/blob/main/TREE/TREEe.cpp
